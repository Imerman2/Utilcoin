Utilcoin
========

Utilcoin is a crypto-currency that eventually (after a decade or two) retains approximately stable value after 
the initial adopter period ends, which as of now is around 15-20 years during which the value should increase rapidly.  

The purpose of a market is to maximize utility (value) of all participants involved.  The Ideal Market perfectly rewards 
all participants directly equal to the utility they create, and the ideal money would be a measure of utility (see Ludwig
Von Mises's "Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonewealth", specifically Ch. 2).  Unfortunately it is impossible
to measure utility, however we can approximate it.  The main point to be gleaned from the fact that a unit of utility
would be the ideal monetary unit is that it has stable value by definition, therefore the ideal crypto-currency must 
eventually reach a state where its value will remain approximately stable.  This is not theorizing in a vacuum, under 150
years of a free-market and gold backing, the dollar retained almost perfectly stable long-term value, therefore there 
is considerable empirical evidence supporting the claim that the free-market will choose a money with stable value.

The only difference between Utilcoin and Bitcoin is number of coins rewarded per block mined, the fact that the mining
reward will be calculated every two weeks along with the re-targetting rate, and the fact that there are two mathematical
equations that must be added together to get the total mining reward:the long-term stable increase (2% of total coins 
per annum) and the regressively decaying rate that incentivizes initial adoption (decaying at a rate of approximately 
77% per year or 35% every four years, rather than the 50% per year of Bitcoin).
